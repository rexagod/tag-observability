    description: >
      Commonly used as an intermediary to simplify operations on the resulting 
      metric set, for eg., creating "default" sets of label values, manipulating
      labels only for the set of metrics that match the given vector, etc.

  - title: Visualization
    description: >
      Commonly used to create visualizations where relations involving 
      aggregated data are concerned.

example_description: > 
  The example below shows that for all metrics with empty `foo` and `bar` label
  values, `foo` will assume the value of `otherFoo`. Futhermore, `bar` will be 
  set to `zero` for all such cases.

  - language: PromQL
